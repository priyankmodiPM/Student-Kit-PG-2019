                                <h3>B. Tech in Computer Science and Engineering</h3>

                                <br>
                        
                        <p>There's a thing in corporate world called Campus to Corporate transition. When I joined IIIT after 4 years of working, for me, my Corporate to Campus Transition journey started. Well how it was going to be, to get out of my comfort zone after these many years- that's what I was about to explore in these 2 years. </p>
                        
                        <p>Did I make the right decision, will I be able to fit in this place? These were the questions that bothered me when I entered this campus. Two years, 4 semesters, 8 mids sems and innumerable  assignments, that's what it took to find the answer. When I started working 4 years back I  had no idea this experience was in store for me.  But here I am reflecting upon these amazing 2 years in terms of opportunities, experiences and learnings I have collected from this place.</p>
                        
                        <p>You get a plethora of opportunities at this place and trust me when I say this, there is no end to your learnings. Who said that engineering colleges don't teach management skills? This place does.  You are the sailor of your own boat in this ocean of challenges and these management skills are going to help you throughout this ride. You name a thing and IIIT provides it all to you. Whatever be your calling, you have committees and forums leading and coming up with innovative events for activities like Coding, research, cultural activities, student welfare and literally everything.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>Initial days here, one often finds himself/herself drowning in the course work expectations, etc. But IIIT was never short of helping hands, be it the amazing seniors who were clearing doubts and taking sessions to get us onboard or my very own batch mates who made sure I was getting through as well. It's true that studying in IIIT is not stress free. In fact, there will be plenty of sleepless night that'll contribute to your learning.  But those nights and those adrenaline rushes for deadlines were made easy by the support of friends and you'll have the tastiest midnight snacks of your life with them.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>IIT teaches you that you can do it! The nightmarish assignments, the ungenerous deadlines and amazingly talented people to compete with, molds you in a way that nothing seems impossible after going through all this. </p>
                        
                        <p>And I will without a doubt would want to relive it. This is what IIIT offers you, trust me you'll love it.</p>

                        <h3>MTech in CSE</h3>
                        <h3>Batch of 2016</h3>
                        <br>
                        <p>Welcome to IIIT-H family!</p>
                        
                            <p>You are going to love being part of this institute:) </p>
                        
                            <p>Education system in IIIT-H is student driven and I personally find that very impressive. Professors are really knowledgeable and have accomplished a lot in the field and still manage to be extremely down to earth.A few of them really care for students' welfare in general and thinking about them still warms my heart up. Things are going to be tough/moderately tough depending on how much you know in the field(They were tough for me :D) but guess what? You will enjoy all of it.
                            I like that all the courses offered focus a lot on assignments and assignments have a big contribution in final evaluation of grades for any course. For most of the subjects assignments are implementing one thing or the other. Exams and tests are also conceptual. Thus the courses you take up will definitely add something to your skill set .</p>
                        
                            <p>The courses and course material is always what the industry demands right now. Everything that is hot in the industry will have a course in our institute. Institute will have opportunities for you to try your hand at research even though you are a M Tech student. You will have lot of mazing opportunities to learn and grow in the industry,you just have to make the most of it ðŸ™‚
                            Apart from that I enjoyed a lot in the campus. Made amazing memories with my friends and had the time of my life here ðŸ™‚
                        </p>
                        
                            <p>I hope you learn a lot here and enjoy even more. And you reach a little closer to your career goal after your time here ðŸ™‚
                        </p>

                        <p>Hello all!<br>
                        Congratulations on being selected in IIIT-H. And big kudos to you for taking the jump from
                        B.Tech to M.Tech, which not many undergraduate students do.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>There may be many reasons why you want to pursue M.Tech. Maybe you were doing a job earlier and now want to broaden your horizons, or you don't have experience yet and want to learn more which perhaps you missed in BTech.Whatever be the case, rest assured IIIT is the place you should be at.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>My first semester here was filled with numerous new learnings. The courses, assignments and most importantly labs are designed in a way that you come at par with the best minds around you.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>There is no restriction on the timings, the labs and library are open till late.(I loved this because my previous college had such strict in-out timings :p) First semester is definitely bit hectic. But trust me, you will be able to do it. There are seniors, your batch mates, all ready to help out. And once this semester is over, that feeling is unmatched. You will discover a completely new side of yourselves.
                        <br>Enjoy the ride folks!!
                        </p>

                        <p>Congratulations on being selected here, all that hardwork finally pays off.</p>
                        
                        <p>
                                It would a big transition from a tier 3 college to here. First few weeks would be tough to deal with, assignments , projects but as a piece of advice , focus on learning       and you will enjoy it for sure and after all research is what IIIT is known for so there would be a lot to explore. 
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>
                                Courses can be found online but this peer group, these assignment deadlines which make you do all of that work in short time , you might feel giving up sometimes but trust me this is what will bring out the best in you. IIIT pushes you out of your comfort zone and you yourself would be amazed by your hidden caliber when you will make it to the end.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>
                                And yeah amidst these assignmnts dont forget to enjoy, make friends ,there will be events you can participate in. I was interested in sketching so was involved with art society in wall painting , after all who doesn't need a break from academic pressure.

                                <p>
                                I am happy to see so many more cases being added to our Family.
                                If you ask me how is the curriculum of Case..good or bad..I would say it's different and interesting than any other structural engineering curriculum. But I suggest you stop wasting your time in comparing and be ready to explore new concepts, to solve your problems by coding in different languages, to live and breathe projects on structural engineering and on earthquake.
                                </p>
                        
                        <p>I won't say that life will be always smooth in these two years. You might struggle at some point and think to give up but believe me the very next moment you get the solution of your problem, you will be flying with your own self made wings.
                                </p>
                        
                        <p>First few months were like an adventure, where you make a ton of friends with your batchmates and seniors, try new and different things you never dreamt of, follow your instincts, find your passions and make your own everlasting memories. From infinite assignments to never ending exams, from sleeping during lectures to working all night for Felicity, IIIT-H has taught me to learn from everything. It has taught me that I can pursue whatever I believe in, if I  try hard enough. It has taught me that Google has solution to every problem. :P </p>
                        
                        <p>Explore yourself in this journey, try to learn as a new experience rather than running after marks or degree coz getting a degree is not a deal in India but having an experience in your own version is.</p>
                        
                        <p>All the best!</p>
